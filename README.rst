First steps (due to May 15th)
-----------

1. Build a project proposal containing:
    1. Project title;
    2. Project category;
    3. What is the problem that you will be investigating? Why is it interesting?
    4. What are the challenges of this project?
    5. What dataset are you using? How do you plan to collect it?
    6. What method or algorithm are you proposing? If there are existing implementations,   will you use them and how? How do you plan to improve or modify such implementations?
    7. What reading will you examine to provide context and background? If relevant, what papers do you refer to?
    8. How will you evaluate your results? Qualitatively, what kind of results do you expect (e.g. plots or figures)? Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate and/or compare your results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)?

Project map (due to May 30th)
------------

1. Identify at least one dataset;
2. Build dataloader for dataset;
3. Build baseline model;
4. Start writing about project (at least 2 pages);
5. Automatic EDA methodology on dataset;
6. Describe the task;
7. Describe how I will apply the paper techinique to retail context
